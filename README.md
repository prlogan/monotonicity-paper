This code (Unexpected.R) performs all calculations and creates all figures used in the submitted paper:
LOGAN, KOVCHEGOV, MONDAL, MORGUN, YAMBARTSEV.  Assessing unexpected correlations in biological networks.

The R script calculates the proportion of pairwise correlations that are positive expected, positive unexpected, negative expected, or negative unexpected, correlation pairs with different signs, and the total proportion that are unexpected at a specified level when using a t-based method, a normal approximation rank based method, a simulated null method, and a randomized p-value method.
